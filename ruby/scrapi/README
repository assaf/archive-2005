== ScrAPI toolkit for Ruby

A framework for writing scrapers using CSS selectors and simple
select => extract => store processing rules.

Here’s an example that scrapes auctions from eBay:

  ebay_auction = Scraper.define do
    process "h3.ens>a", :description=>:text,
                        :url=>"@href"
    process "td.ebcPr>span", :price=>:text
    process "div.ebPicture >a>img", :image=>"@src"

    result :description, :url, :price, :image
  end

  ebay = Scraper.define do
    array :auctions

    process "table.ebItemlist tr.single",
            :auctions => ebay_auction

    result :auctions
  end

And using the scraper:

  auctions = ebay.scrape(html)

  # No. of auctions found
  puts auctions.size

  # First auction:
  auction = auctions[0]
  puts auction.description
  puts auction.url

== Using TIDY

By default scrAPI uses Tidy to cleanup the HTML.

You need to install the Tidy Gem for Ruby:
  gem install tidy

And the Tidy binary libraries, available here:

  http://tidy.sourceforge.net/

By default scrAPI looks for the Tidy DLL (Windows) or shared library (Linux) in the directory lib/tidy. That's one place to place the Tidy library.

Alternatively, just point Tidy to the library with:

  Tidy.path = "...."

On Linux this would probably be:

  Tidy.path = "/usr/local/lib/libtidy.so"

On OS/X this would probably be:

  Tidy.path = “/usr/lib/libtidy.dylib”

For testing purposes, you can also use the built in HTML parser. It's useful for testing and getting up to grabs with scrAPI, but it doesn't deal well with broken HTML. So for testing only:

  Scraper::Base.parser :html_parser
