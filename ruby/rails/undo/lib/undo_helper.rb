# Use the undo helper to maintain a list of undo actions and render
# a button to perform the last undo action.
#
# For example:
#   # Remove undo action from stack.
#   before_filter do |controller|
#     controller.undo.pop(controller.params) if controller.params[:undo]
#     true
#   end
#
#   def create()
#     # Do some action that can be undone.
#     record = Record.create(@params)
#     # Create a new undo action (if not itself an undo).
#     unless @params[:undo]
#       undo.push("Delete newly created record",
#         :action=>"delete", :id=>record.id)
#     end
#     # Using XHR unpdate the undo action on the page.
#     render :update do |page|
#       page["undo"].replace_html undo.render
#     end
#   end

        # The +url+ argument is a hash used for the form action URL.
        # The parameter <tt>:undo=>true</tt> is automatically added.
        #
        # For example:

        # action to remove it from the stack, making the last undo action (or
        # no undo action) available.
        #
        # The request parameters are used to remove a specific undo action,
        # to deal with multiple pages at the same time.

        # and no disabled options specified.

        # This method does not remove the undo action from the stack.
        #
        # When called without a block, returns a form for the last undo
        # action with a single button. Uses the specified caption and
        # formatting options. If missing, the default caption is "Undo".
        #
        # If there are no undo actions, returns an empty string. If there
        # are no undo actions but the <tt>:disabled</tt> option is specified,
        # returns a form with a button formatted using these options.
        #
        # The following options are supported:
        # * <tt>:form</tt> -- HTML options to format the +form+ tag.
        # * <tt>:button</tt> -- HTML options to format the +submit+ tag
        #   for an undo action.
        # * <tt>:disabled</tt> -- HTML options to format the +submit+ tag
        #   if there is no undo action.
        #
        # For example:
        #   undo.render "Undo", :form=>{:class=>"undo-form"},
        #      :button=>{:class=>"undo-button"}
        # 
        # When called with a block, yields the undo action and title to the
        # block and returns the result. Yields a hash with the keys
        # <tt>:url</tt> and <tt>:title</tt> for the last undo action. Yields
        # +nil+ if there is no undo action on the stack.
