= Microformat Parser

MicroformatParser is a Ruby module for creating microformat parsers.
A microformat parser is a class with a set of rules for extracting
interesting content from (X)HTML documents. You create your own parser
by writing a class with a set of rules. The magic happens in the parse
method which taks an (X)HTML document or element, runs all the rules
on it, and returns new object that holds the extracted valus.

Here's a simple example to find all links and all tags in a document:

  class MyParser
    include MicroformatParser

    rule :links, "a", "a@href"
    rule :tags, "a[rel~=tag]", "text()"
  end

  content = MyParser.parse(doc)
  puts "Found " + content.links.size + " links" if content.links
  puts "Tagged with " + content.tags.join(', ') if content.tags
